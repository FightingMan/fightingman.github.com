    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like bananas,but you gave me a car of apples,then you were moved to tears by yourself and asked me why I'm not moved.</p>

<p>I have no words,then you told the world you have spent all your money to buy a car of apples for me,but I'm not moved any more,I must have a heart of stone and my character has a problem!</p>

<p>I just like banana...?!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre><code>Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

Well, they said it was time for changing
Rise and shine
Everybody's making it, but you
And they told you to trust your dreaming
But it's hard to believe a feeling
That you just don't know

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

You've been trying to walk on water
In the end everybody
Walked all over you

Now, you don't like the sight of mirrors
Cause you're scared that the face
You'll see, will look just like before

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

All I want is you
Let me take you back
Where you once belonged
All I want is you
It will be alright if you come along
You were never gone

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites
Satellites
