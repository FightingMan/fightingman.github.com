    Even an angel can end up falling
    Don't you cry, because you're crawling
    Start again, it's a beautiful morning
    For satellites

    Well, they said it was time for changing
    Rise and shine
    Everybody's making it, but you
    And they told you to trust your dreaming
    But it's hard to believe a feeling
    That you just don't know

    Even an angel can end up falling
    Don't you cry, because you're crawling
    Start again, it's a beautiful morning
    For satellites

    Even an angel can end up falling
    Don't you cry, because you're crawling
    Start again, it's a beautiful morning
    For satellites

    You've been trying to walk on water
    In the end everybody
    Walked all over you

    Now, you don't like the sight of mirrors
    Cause you're scared that the face
    You'll see, will look just like before

    Even an angel can end up falling
    Don't you cry, because you're crawling
    Start again, it's a beautiful morning
    For satellites

    Even an angel can end up falling
    Don't you cry, because you're crawling
    Start again, it's a beautiful morning
    For satellites

    All I want is you
    Let me take you back
    Where you once belonged
    All I want is you
    It will be alright if you come along
    You were never gone

    Even an angel can end up falling
    Don't you cry, because you're crawling
    Start again, it's a beautiful morning
    For satellites

    Even an angel can end up falling
    Don't you cry, because you're crawling
    Start again, it's a beautiful morning
    For satellites

    Even an angel can end up falling
    Don't you cry, because you're crawling
    Start again, it's a beautiful morning
    For satellites
    Satellites
