There are some handy operator with command line:
    [Ctrl-d] #This exits shell or closes input on programs waiting for STDIN.NOTE: there must be no such thing as an end of file character.
    [Ctrl-z] #This suspend a process u r running in foreground. Get it back by running 'fg', background it using 'bg'.
    [Ctrl-c] #This canceling a running program,Ctrl-C can be used before you run cammand to "cancel" the line edit and start anew.
    [Ctrl-b] #Move to the begging of the current or previous word. NOTE: base on keyboard mapping sometimes.
    [Ctrl-f] #Move to the end of the current or next word. NOTE: base on keyboard mapping sometimes.
    [Ctrl-w] #Remove the previous word.
    [Ctrl-l] #Clear screen.
    [Ctrl-K] #Delete/Yank everything from cursor to the end of line.
    [Ctrl-U] #Delete/Yank everything from cursor to the begging of the line.
    [Ctrl-e] #Move your cursor to the end of the line.
    [Ctrl-a] #move your cursor to the begging of the line.
    [Ctrl-r] #Reverse search through your command history for 'input'. ESC when done.
    [Ctrl--] #Manial lists this as Ctrl-_ but Ctrl-- ususally works too.Incremental undo of command line edits.

Look forward to your supplementary :).
