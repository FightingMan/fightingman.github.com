I pursued a girl for six years whose name is Rever the most beautiful girl in the world. 

In Dec. 22, We fell in love :).

Thanks to Mayans that they can only help me so much,if without their help I think I'll lose myself.

I'm not good at talking and writting,but you must know Rever you'er my only princess all the time,I'll guard you to the old.

I'll realizing all your dreams,you must be the happiest girl in the world.

Other words,now we'er not together in the same place,wait and give me some time,I'm standing by my words,the line must be fruit.

Anyway,I feel I'm the happiest man in these days,miss you Rever,I think I'm so lucky.
