I like bananas,but you gave me a car of apples,then you were moved to tears by yourself and asked me why I'm not moved.

I have no words,then you told the world you have spent all your money to buy a car of apples for me,but I'm not moved any more,I must have a heart of stone and my character has a problem! 

I just like banana...?!
